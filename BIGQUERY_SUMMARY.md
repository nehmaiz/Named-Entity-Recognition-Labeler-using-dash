## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Schema
Four main BigQuery tables are automatically created:

1. **`texts`** - Source texts for annotation
2. **`annotations`** - Entity annotations with user tracking
3. **`annotation_history`** - Complete audit trail
4. **`user_sessions`** - User session tracking

### Key Features Implemented

#### 📥 **Text Loading**
- Load text instances from BigQuery with filtering
- Batch loading with configurable limits
- Status tracking (pending/in_progress/completed)
- Priority-based ordering

#### 🏷️ **Multi-User Annotation**
- User identification and session management
- Real-time annotation with user attribution
- Timestamp tracking for all changes
- Conflict resolution and user permissions

#### 📊 **Complete Audit Trail**
- Every annotation action (add/remove) is logged
- User attribution for all changes
- Session tracking across annotation workflows
- Historical data preservation

#### 💾 **Data Persistence**
- Automatic upload to BigQuery after annotation
- Batch operations for performance
- Error handling and retry logic
- Data validation and schema enforcement

#### 📈 **Analytics & Reporting**
- Real-time user statistics
- Progress tracking across texts
- Annotation quality metrics
- Export capabilities for ML pipelines

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements_bigquery.txt
```

### 2. Set Up BigQuery
```bash
# Basic setup
python setup_bigquery.py --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# With sample data
python setup_bigquery.py --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --create-sample-data

# Test connection
python setup_bigquery.py --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --test-connection
```

### 3. Configure Authentication
Choose one method:
- **Service Account**: Download JSON key and set path in config
- **User Credentials**: Run `gcloud auth application-default login`  
- **Environment**: Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable

### 4. Run the Demo
```bash
python bigquery_demo.py
```
Visit: http://localhost:8053

## 💡 Usage Workflow

1. **Load Texts**: Import text instances from BigQuery tables
2. **Set Username**: Identify yourself for user tracking
3. **Navigate Texts**: Browse through loaded texts for annotation
4. **Annotate**: Select text spans and assign entity labels
5. **Track History**: View real-time annotation history and user activity
6. **Save to BigQuery**: Upload annotations with complete audit trail
7. **Monitor Progress**: View statistics and export data

## 🔧 API Examples

### Loading Texts
```python
manager = BigQueryNERManager(project_id="your-project")
texts_df = manager.load_texts_for_annotation(limit=10, status="pending")
```

### Uploading Annotations
```python
entities = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "Apple Inc.",
        "label": "ORGANIZATION",
        "start": 0,
        "end": 10
    }
]

success = manager.upload_annotations(
    text_id="text_001",
    entities=entities,
    user_id="user123",
    username="annotator",
    session_id="session_uuid"
)
```

### Getting Statistics
```python
stats = manager.get_user_statistics(user_id="user123")
history = manager.get_annotation_history(text_id="text_001")
```
